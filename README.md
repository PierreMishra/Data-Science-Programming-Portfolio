## [Project 1: US Dam Safety & HUC-8 Runoff](https://github.com/PierreMishra/US_Dam_Safety_ENV.872)
* Worked with CSV and shapefiles and processed the data to prepare for furter analysis
* Explored variables for 90,000 dams that can predict dam safety in the US using National Inventory of Dams dataset by US Army Corps
* Performed ordinal logistic regression on logged predictor variables to determine the effects of various physical features of a dam on its classified safety hazard
* Investigated the stream discharge trends in North Carolina (NC) to find whether changing runoff pose a threat to dam structures
* Performed montonic trend analysis to determine the annaul run-off trends in hydrologic unit 8 (HUC-8) sub basins of NC using USGS Waterwatch dataset
* Layered the dams and run-off analysis as shapefiles within NC boundary to observe the spatial distribution of dams with varying risks in sub basins with increasing or decreasing run-off trends.

## [Project 2: Global Lung Cancer Rates](https://github.com/PierreMishra/Lung_Cancer_Rates_ENV.710)
* Wrangled and manipulated data from different CSV files into one dataframe
* Explored environmental and socio-economic variables of 152 nations to analyze their effects on lung cancer rates.
* Implemented ordinary least square (OLS) method to estimate the parameters of multiple linear regression models.
* Developed three OLS models for all nations, high-income nations (with GDP per capita > $15,000) and low-income nations (with GDP per capita < $15,000)
