## [Project 1: US Dam Safety & Cilmate Change](https://github.com/PierreMishra/US_Dam_Safety_ENV.872)
* Explored variables for 90,000 dams that can predict dam safety in the US using National Inventory of Dams dataset by US Army Corps
* Performed ordinal logistic regression on logged predictor variables to determine the effects of various physical features of a dam on its classified safety hazard
* Investigated the stream discharge trends in North Carolina (NC) to find whether changing runoff pose a threat to dam structures
* Performed montonic trend analysis to determine the annaul run-off trends in hydrologic unit 8 (HUC-8) sub basins of NC using USGS Waterwatch dataset
* Overlapped dam and run-off shapefiles within NC boundary to observe the spatial distribution of dams with varying risks in sub basins with increasing or decreasing run-off trends.
